#### static hand-crafted feature

Static hand-crafted features refer to manually designed and predefined features that are extracted from raw data, such as images, text, or signals. These features are typically engineered by domain experts or researchers based on their understanding of the problem domain. The term "static" implies that these features are fixed and do not change during the learning or analysis process.

In contrast to dynamic or learned features, static hand-crafted features are designed based on prior knowledge and are not adapted or modified during the training of a machine learning model. These features are commonly used in traditional machine learning approaches, where feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the model's performance.

For example, in image processing, static hand-crafted features may include aspects like color histograms, texture descriptors, or edge information. In natural language processing, features could include word frequencies, syntactic structures, or sentiment scores.

While static hand-crafted features have been widely used in the past, recent advances in deep learning have enabled the automatic learning of features directly from raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering in some cases. However, in certain scenarios, static hand-crafted features can still be valuable for providing interpretability, improving model generalization, or addressing data limitations.
